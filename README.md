# Capstone Demonstration Robot

**Authors:** Martin Lee, Benjamin Liu, Kathryn Nguyen, Aron Saengchan, and Michael Shipman

### Summary
Minds in Motion is a collaboration between the Faculty of Kinesiology, Active Living, and the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary. They run a variety of initiatives including providing interactive, hands-on programs for grade school students. Minds in Motion has been exploring new ways to expand their current platform and incorporate engineering concepts into their programs. They are directly collaborating with the Schulich School of Engineering to develop a new program, which includes an in-class demonstration and an interactive workshop.

The demonstration portion of this program includes a mobile mechanical robot that illustrates fundamental principles of work & energy and kinematics to successfully shoot a projectile into a target within a specified range. This demonstration introduces students to basic principles of mechanical, electrical, and robotic systems. In the hopes of sparking student interest in the STEM field, this demonstration intends to educate them on the robotâ€™s capabilities and inspire them to pursue similar projects for themselves.

This project was completed as part of my undergraduate capstone project during my final year at the University of Calgary.
